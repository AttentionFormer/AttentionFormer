## Get Started

1. Install Python 3.6, PyTorch 1.9.0.
2. Download data. You can obtain all the six benchmarks from [[Autoformer](https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer)] or [[Informer](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020)].
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results by:

```bash
bash ./scripts/run.sh
```
